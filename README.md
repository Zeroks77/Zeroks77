### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Zeroks77 or Zero. 
I am 25 and have just finished my education.
I am currently working with the Microsoft Dynamic Stack, programming in TypeScript and C# to customise the system.

I'm trying to learn as much as I can find and become an excellent programmer who produces value instead of bugs.
When I'm not in the programming world, I'm probably spending time with my girlfriend or playing some video games.

Hit me with your best shot and don't hesitate to ask me anything.
